### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Michael Miller and I am currently a second-semester Junior in AER E 361 at Iowa State. I am majoring in Aerospace Engineering and I am working on two minors, one in Computer Science and the other in Psychology. I recently completed a co-op at Collins Aerospace working in a Systems Engineering role over the Spring/Summer of 2023. I also have experience in undergraduate research both here at Iowa State and at Mizzou.

In this course I am interested to learn / see how developed code interacts / instructs a physical system. So far, I have not seen code that I have developed in courses do something to a physical object, so that is something I hope to look forward to. I am also interested to continue developing my programming skills throughout this course. Another thing I hope to gain from this class is an improved ability in technical documentation of work. Whether that is in coding or in report writing, I think that this class will help me improve on those skills so that I can provide a good reference for my work to my future self and others.

My favorite passtimes include watching movies, playing sports (basketball, volleyball, soccer, football, spikeball, disc golf, etc...), listening to music, reading, and generally anything outdoors. I am hoping to join some more intramurals this fall at ISU (have participated in pool, mini golf, and some fantasy football/basketball ones thus far). I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family.

That's a little about me. For any questions please reach me at my email: mjm4402@iastate.edu
